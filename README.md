# Todo-List

This is a simple Todo List Application created with React App.
Creating this App helped me to practice the concept of passing data from a child component to a parent component.
Also I employed the concept of conditional rendering.
I do hope to add more functionalities as I my learning progresses..

Here is a <a href ="https://nathaniyell.github.io/Todo-List/">link</a> to the app
